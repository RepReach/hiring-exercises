# Hiring @ RepReach

Hello! If you're reading this then we're likely in the process of chatting with you about a technical role at [RepReach](https://getrepreach.com)

In order to move forward, we'd like to know a little about how you work. To that end, this repository contains a set of short, timeboxed (1-3 hours max) exercises that you can use to demonstrate your skills and abilities.


## General Instructions

1. Choose an exercise directory that matches your primary domain. This is the area in which you feel the most comfortable and have the highest degree of mastery
    * [frontend](frontend/instructions.md)

2. Read the `instructions.md` file in the matching directory. Be sure to read the instructions carefully and ask any clarifying questions either via [Github issues](https://github.com/pdepip/hiring-exercises/issues) or by emailing pat@getrepreach.com

3. Create a new **private repository** for your exercise and add the RepReach hiring team members as private collaborators (We do this to preserve your anonymity so it's not obvious you are looking for a new role.)
    * [Pat @ RepReach (CTO)](https://github.com/pdepip) 

4. Complete as much of the exercise as you can in 3-6 hours or less. Unless otherwise specified in the `instructions.md` document, you can use any language, framework, or toolchain you wish, although ideally this would be Typescript (ReactJS/React Native), node.js and SQL (purely because those are the languages we use to build RepReach and will be the most familiar with)

5. Be sure to include the following in your submission
    * a `README.md` with the following information
        * **A few screenshots of the finished product**. Show off that work! ðŸ“¸
        * A short explanation of what you built
        * How to test/demo/run (if applicable)
            * NOTE: a 'working' exercise is awesome, however it is NOT a hard requirement. We mean it!
        * Any feedback/notes (i.e. if something was hard, confusing, frustrating, etc)
        * Anything else you'd lke us to know about your submission
    * a `ROADMAP.md` with what you would add/change if you had more time. Dream big.
    * a super-simple test suite if applicable (even one test is a bonus)
    * Some form of lightweight technical documentation (code comments are fine)

5. When complete email a link to the repository and any special instructions to pat@getrepreach.com

6. Sit back and relax. We'll review your submission and get back to you within 48 hours :smiley:
